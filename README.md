<B>Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge</B>

Challenge is to implement two features:

    1. Calculate the total number of times each word has been tweeted.

    2. Calculate the median number of unique words per tweet, and update this median as tweets come in.

*******************************************************************************************************************'''


Run 'run.sh' for execution of python program: process_tweets.py

program expects tweets.txt in in tweets_input folder, with tweets. File is read using utf-8 rather than ascii, with this option ascii would work too.

Output of task-1, total number of times each word has been tweeted, would be written to tweet_output/ft1.txt

Output of task-2, median number of unique words per tweet, would be written to tweet_output/ft2.txt
